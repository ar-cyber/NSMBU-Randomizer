This is a Python script to randomise the NSMBU level contents.
<br>
## Requirements
- Python 3
- `SarcLib` and `libyaz0` (`_main.py` will prompt you to install these)

### To start: 
Run either `_main.py` or `run.py`.

# When finished:
- When you open the emulator, make sure you spam 2 as no UI for the start shows up.
- TOAD HOUSES ARE A SOFTLOCK, SKIP THEM IS NECESSARY.
- IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THIS IS PLAYED USING A 100% SAVE - THE CHALLENGE LEVELS ARE PRESENT AND MAY SOFTLOCK.

## Building this:
You do not need to build it, it is prebuilt. Running `run.py` runs the built version.
