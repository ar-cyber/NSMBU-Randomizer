# READ THIS BEFORE BEGINNING. THIS RANDOMISER CANNOT BE USED FOR MUSIC. 
This is a Python script to randomise the NSMBU level contents.
<br>
## Requirements
- Python 3
- `SarcLib` and `libyaz0` (`_main.py` will prompt you to install these)

### To start: 
Run either `_main.py` or `run.py`.

# This can take up to 4 hours. Please let it do it's thing. THE WINDOW DOES NOT NEED TO BE OPEN TO RANDOMISE THE FILES.

## Building this:
You do not need to build it, it is prebuilt. Running `run.py` runs the built version.
