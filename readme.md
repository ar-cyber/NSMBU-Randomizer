# NSMB U/U Deluxe/NSLU randomizer

This mod effectively shuffles the level files of New Super (Mario Bros/Luigi) U/U Deluxe files. It can be used with some other games, although untested.

## How to use?

### Requirements:
- Python 3+: `https://python.org`
- Pip with the following modules installed (you will be prompted to install them): `SarcLib`, `libyaz0`

### Running the Program:
1. Clear out the CopyOfFiles folder. <br>
2. Copy all of the `course_res_pack` folder into the CopyOfFiles folder (use UWizard to extract the wud file for your rom) <br>
3. Run the `_main.py` script. <br><br>

FINISING THIS CAN TAKE UP TO 2+ HOURS. PLEASE BE PATIENT. 

### Recommendations for running the mod: 
- Use a 5-Star save. There will be points where you will be softlocked.
- GETTING ANY ITEMS FROM A ITEM TOAD HOUSE CRASHES THE GAME. Make sure to pick a bowser to get nothing.
- Some levels will not open. This is not on the randomiser, but probably because the level is the title screen.
<br> <br>
IF YOU RUN INTO ANY ISSUES WHEN RUNNING THE MOD, REINSTALL THE GAME'S `META.XML` FILE.
