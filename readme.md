# NSMB U/U Deluxe/NSLU randomizer

This mod effectively shuffles the level files of New Super (Mario Bros/Luigi) U/U Deluxe files. It can be used with some other games, although untested.
<br><br>
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Arulo165">Arulo165</a>, there is now an item randomizer present in a subdirectory. Deploy that like you would deploy any other mod for NSMBU/NSLU. Currently only supports EU roms.

## How to use?

### Requirements:
- Python 3+: `https://python.org`
- Pip with the following modules installed (you will be prompted to install them): `SarcLib`, `libyaz0`

### Running the Program:
1. Clear out the CopyOfFiles folder. <br>
2. Copy all of the contents in `course_res_pack` folder into the CopyOfFiles folder (use UWizard to extract the wud file for your rom) <br>
3. Run the `_main.py` script. <br>
4. Copy everything from `CopyOfFiles` to your `course_res_pack` folder.<br>
5. Launch your emulator (use cemu) or your Wii U (only use a Wii U if you know what you're doing)<br><br>
FINISING THIS CAN TAKE UP TO 2+ HOURS. PLEASE BE PATIENT. 

### Notes: 
- GETTING ANY ITEMS FROM A TOAD HOUSE CRASHES THE GAME. Make sure to first pick a bowser to get nothing.
- As of 1.1, lots of issues regarding softlocks have been patched. Do not go the back way into Roy's castle, however.
- Not all levels have secret exits - you may not be able to get to secret levels.
- You CAN beat the game (kinda).
<br><br>
IF YOU RUN INTO ANY ISSUES WHEN RUNNING THE MOD, REINSTALL THE GAME'S `META.XML` FILE.
